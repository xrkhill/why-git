# Why I think we should switch to Git

## Inexpensive Local Branches

### Features

* Branching and merging is easy
* You can use local branches and don't have to share them (useful for testing)

### Benefits

* Encourages creativity, because you can keep a seperate test branch and experiment, without having to share it or without having to loose your ability to make changes to the master (aka trunk)
