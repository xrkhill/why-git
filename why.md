# Why I think we should switch to Git

## Inexpensive Local Branches

* Branching and merging is easy
* You can use local branches and don't have to share them (useful for testing)
* Encourages creativity, because you can keep a seperate test branch and experiment, without having to share it or without having to loose your ability to make changes to the master (aka trunk)

## Stash

* Saves the changes you are currently working on to a "scratch pad"
* lets you apply them later
* prevents the "desktop backup"
* lets you work on "urgent" matters, and then get back to what you were in the middle of
* easy way to move code around branches???

## Speed

* most operations are local, so no need to wait for the network
* Git is faster than SVN for most operations, anyway

## GitHub

* It's easier to get access to many of the Open Source projects we use (Cake, Rails, jQuery, Spree, and plugins for all of the above)
